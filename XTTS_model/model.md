# About "model.pth"

The `model.pth` file was corrupted during download due to unpredictable network fluctuations.

However, the results of the entire experiment are still highly reproducible, using the method provided by [ⓍTTS - TTS 0.22.0 documentation](https://docs.coqui.ai/en/latest/models/xtts.html#training).
