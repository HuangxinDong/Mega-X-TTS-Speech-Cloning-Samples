# XTTS-Tacotron2-Speech-Cloning-Samples
This repository stores sample projects for my undergraduate thesis on speech cloning using XTTS and Tacotron 2 models separately.

The speech data used in this example is from the [AISHELL-3 Open Source HI-FI Mandarin Speech corpus](https://www.aishelltech.com/aishell_3), with the speaker ID being SSB0139.

Sample: `SSB01390359.wav`

> The two men and one woman in this case all have their own familys. (这起案件当中的两男一女都另有家室)
